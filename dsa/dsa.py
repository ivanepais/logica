"""
Data Structures is about how data can be stored in different structures.

Algorithms is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.

DSA helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.

DS:

Is a way to store data.
Depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.
If we want to store data about people we are related to.
We use a family tree as the data structure.
Because we have a lot of information to store. 
And we need to link the data with each other.

Essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
They help in managing and organizing data, reduce complexity, and increase efficiency.

"""


"""
Two different data structures:

Primitive: int, float, char, boolean 

No primitive or reference type to an object: with methods
Abstract Data Structures are higher-level
Include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
"""


"""
Algorithms:

Step-by-step instructions for executing tasks.
Solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.
An efficient algorithm can help us to find the solution we are looking for.
Transform a slow program into a faster one.

Eg. Fastest route, Finding elem in a search, sorting by filter

Algorithmsto solve specific problems, and are often made to work on specific data structures.
'Bubble Sort' algorithm is designed to sort values, and is made to work on arrays

"""
DSA:
Is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, and to solve specific problems.
Decide which data structure or algorithm is best for a given situation.
Make programs that run faster or use less memory.
Understand how to approach complex problems and solve them in a systematic way

is fundamental in nearly every part of the software world:
Operating Systems
Database Systems
Web Applications
Machine Learning
Video Games
Cryptographic Systems
Data Analysis
Search Engines

Algorithm:
A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem.

Data Structure:
A way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently. 
Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, and binary trees.

Time Complexity:
A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.

Space Complexity:
A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.

Big O Notation:
A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used in this tutorial to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.

Recursion:
A programming technique where a function calls itself.

Divide and Conquer:
A method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions. Recursion is often used when using this method in an algorithm.

Brute Force:
A simple and straight forward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best one
